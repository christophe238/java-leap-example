Leap Motion and Java3D - Project structure example

As I couldn't find any examples using leap motion controller with java/java3D, here is a structure example of a Java3D project using leap motion as a controller.

Don't hesitate to ask any question or submit any comment, remark or improvement idea.


About this project : 
It's a simple 3D cube displayed with X,Y and Z axis. Top is green, bottom is red just to remember that your not upside down.
Move your hand over your leap motion controller to translate camera along axis.
